## Summary from “Agent brief”

The rule authoring page must present all visible, user-facing text in CSS red (`#ff0000`). The
existing rule-authoring workflow, content, controls, permissions, and layout remain unchanged. The
primary verification is a screenshot of the default rule authoring view after it has loaded.

## Requirements

- Render all visible user-facing text on the default rule authoring page in CSS `#ff0000` without
  changing the page's existing behavior. (S1) [color-red:REQ-001]
- Preserve the existing rule-authoring content, layout, controls, loading behavior, and permission
  behavior while applying the color change. (S1) [color-red:REQ-002]
- Limit the color change to the rule authoring page; unrelated pages and hidden or unloaded content
  are outside this requirement. (S1) [color-red:REQ-003]

Acceptance criteria:

- A screenshot of the normally loaded default rule authoring view shows every visible user-facing
  text element in CSS `#ff0000`. (S1) [color-red:AC-001]
- The screenshot shows the existing rule authoring page structure and controls, with no required
  workflow or permission change. (S1) [color-red:AC-002]

## Non-functional requirements

- The color update must not add a measurable delay to the existing page load; verify by confirming
  the default view reaches its existing loaded state under the same project startup conditions.
  (S1) [color-red:REQ-004]
- Text must remain legible and the existing page layout must not shift as a result of the color
  update; verify in the required screenshot condition. (S1) [color-red:REQ-005]

## Boundary conditions

- The scope is the rule authoring page only.
- “All visible text” means every user-facing text element visible in the default rule authoring
  view, including labels and controls; it does not include hidden or unloaded content.
- The required color is exactly CSS `#ff0000`; no alternate red, gradient, opacity adjustment, or
  color-dependent interaction is specified.
- The page's existing viewport and default loaded state are the screenshot verification conditions.
