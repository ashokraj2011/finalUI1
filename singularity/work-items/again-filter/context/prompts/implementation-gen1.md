# Active Story phase contract: Implementation

- Work ID: `again-filter`
- Work type: `chore`
- Phase: `implementation`
- Generation to author: 1
- Generation requirement: `required`
- Default publication producer: `governed-agent`
- Allowed publication producers: `governed-agent`, `human`
- Required publication channel: `copilot-host`
- Clarification mode: `when-needed`
- Clarification authority: this pinned mode overrides generic skill, agent, and template guidance.
- Exact publication command: `singularity-flow phase publish implementation --authored governed-agent --channel copilot-host`
- Publication boundary: Use the exact configured producer, channel, and command. Never substitute a convenient authorship route.
- Repository root: `.` (the verified current repository checkout)
- Work-item directory: `singularity/work-items/again-filter`
- Required artifact: `singularity/work-items/again-filter/artifacts/implementation/implementation-summary.md`
- Authored content: at least 250 UTF-8 bytes; managed metadata and approved-input blocks do not count.
- Required Markdown headings: none beyond the configured template.
- Completion rule: replace every TODO, TBD, unresolved template marker, and configured forbidden placeholder; an unchanged prepared template is refused.
- Recovery rule: author substantive governed content; byte padding alone is not completion.
- Path boundary: Resolve every named path inside the work-item directory or repository root. Never search the filesystem outside this repository.
- Write scope: `source-and-artifact`
- Intelligence: world-model=`inherit`, AST=`available on request; ordinary repository file access is the default`, agent-briefs=`inherit`

# again-filter — Implementation Summary

## Agent brief

<!--
Summarize the implemented outcome, consequential decisions, changed surfaces, validation result,
remaining limitations, and rollout considerations for downstream agents. Keep it evidence-based;
the detailed changed-components and test sections are preserved separately.
-->

## Implemented outcome

TODO: Summarize the implemented behavior.

## Changed components and decisions

TODO: Cite code, configuration, migrations, and deviations from the specification.

## Tests and operational notes

TODO: List AC-nnn/SPEC-nnn-tagged tests, commands, limitations, flags, and rollout notes.

# Pinned Story source

- Immutable source: `singularity/work-items/again-filter/source.json`
- SHA-256: `8f79322b99785c15c46e13d8a020f01d6f88585c73f255433708dc26e1410ced`
- Authority: this is the requested outcome. Later evidence may refine missing detail but may not silently contradict or replace it.
- Conflict recovery: if a human answer or approved artifact conflicts with this source, stop and use `singularity-flow story intent-amendment propose --file <FILE> --reason "<REASON>"`; recompose only after the amendment is governed.

# Human clarification checkpoint

The `implementation` phase uses clarification mode `when-needed`.
Prioritize material uncertainty about: approved deviations, implementation blockers.

- Ask only when a material ambiguity remains after reading the governed evidence.
- If none remains, state that the clarification checkpoint found no material ambiguity and continue.
- Ask one concise batch of no more than 3 questions with the interactive `ask_user` tool.
- Derive every question only from the current Story’s pinned sources, approved upstream artifacts, repository world model, or contradictions among them. Never reuse example questions or placeholder text from templates.
- Do not ask for information already established by pinned sources, approved upstream artifacts, or the repository world model.
- If a proposed answer contradicts the pinned Story source, stop. Do not record it as an ordinary clarification or author over the source; use `singularity-flow story intent-amendment propose --file <FILE> --reason "<REASON>"`, then recompose after governance resolves it.
- Treat pinned evidence as fact. Label every hypothesis or proposed design explicitly; never convert it into an acceptance or specification decision without human confirmation.
- For each question, explain briefly why the answer changes the governed output. Offer a recommended/default choice when the evidence supports one.
- Do not infer an answer from generic knowledge. The user may explicitly answer “unknown” or defer a non-blocking decision.
- After the response, incorporate confirmed answers into the phase artifact as decisions. Keep explicitly deferred items in Open questions with their impact and owner.
- Stage only {"responses":[...]} at the Git-private path returned by `git rev-parse --git-path singularity-flow/clarification-responses/implementation-gen<N>.json`, then run `singularity-flow clarification record implementation --response-file <that-path>` and remove the staging file after success. Never write response input to the CLI-owned `singularity/work-items/**/context/clarifications-*.json` durable path.
- A material unresolved decision remains blocking through specification publication; do not hide it behind a recommendation or placeholder.
- If `ask_user` is unavailable, print the numbered questions and stop before authoring or publication. Never turn missing interactivity into silent assumptions.
- Do not author or publish the governed output until the checkpoint is complete.

# Developer agent

Resolve the active Story checkout with `singularity-flow session current --json`; require `ready`, bind `workId`, and use its absolute `repositoryPath` as cwd for every shell and file tool. Otherwise use `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`; if neither resolves, stop. Never search `$HOME`, a parent directory, or outside that repository. Governed artifacts are under `singularity/work-items/<WORK-ID>/`.

Restate the approved objective and applicable acceptance/specification items. Inspect governed repository evidence before changing code. Prefer the smallest coherent change that follows existing boundaries, conventions, error handling, and tests. Do not expand scope or silently resolve ambiguity. Record changed files, commands actually run, evidence, residual risk, and approved deviations.

When the composed phase prompt includes bounded structural context from a compatible extractor, use a focused AST query before broad text search for symbol, import, or relationship discovery: `singularity-flow wm ast query --predicate symbol|import|language|path --value <VALUE> --max-facts 50 --max-output-bytes 32768 --json`, or the equivalent `wm.ast.query` gateway read. If the prompt reports no structural facts, an unsupported language, text-only assurance, or unavailable AST, continue with ordinary repository file access without retrying AST. Follow `nextCursor` only while the question remains unanswered. Treat `text` assurance as a search lead, never proof that a declaration exists; syntax or semantic claims require the named extractor recorded in the result.

Obey the composed phase prompt's pinned clarification mode before this agent guidance. For `off`, never ask or record phase clarification. For `when-needed`, ask and record only when a material implementation blocker or approved-specification deviation remains; otherwise continue without a record. For `required`, ask one bounded batch with `ask_user`, wait, and record accepted answers before continuing. Do not reopen settled product or architecture choices implicitly.

- Files indexed: 83
- Languages: TypeScript (47), JavaScript (3)
- Likely entry points: `server/index.js`, `src/app/kernel/index.ts`, `src/main.ts`
- Validation commands: `npm run build`, `npm run client`, `npm run ng`, `npm run server`

This model was generated locally and consumed **zero model tokens**. It records only deterministic repository metadata. It does not claim runtime behavior, business meaning, ownership, security, test coverage, or architectural intent. Build a quick, standard, or deep model when semantic analysis is worth the token cost.

# again-filter — Chore Intake

## Objective

Add a Filter block to the Rule Visual Designer so records can be ordered by a configured attribute and reduced to the first, last, or a configured range before rule evaluation. The block must be available in the designer block palette and placeable on the designer canvas; it must not be added to Functions.

## Scope and validation

- [again-filter:REQ-001] Implement the Rule Visual Designer Filter block with ordering configuration and first, last, and range row-selection modes.
- Keep the Filter block out of the Functions area and preserve existing Function behavior.
- [again-filter:AC-001] Start the application, open the Rule Visual Designer, and capture a screenshot showing the Filter block and its controls. Attach the screenshot to the test results.
- Validate that the designer remains usable and that existing Functions continue to render without the new block.

## Risk and rollback

The primary risk is that designer registration or configuration changes could affect existing blocks or rule-evaluation ordering. Contain the change behind the existing designer block registration and Filter configuration path, and verify the Functions view remains unchanged. Roll back by reverting the Filter block and its registration/configuration changes if the designer or existing rule behavior regresses.

# Final clarification guard

The pinned clarification mode for `implementation` is `when-needed`; this instruction overrides conflicting generic skill, agent, template, or repository prose.
Ask and record a bounded batch only if material ambiguity remains after governed evidence is read; otherwise continue without a clarification record.
